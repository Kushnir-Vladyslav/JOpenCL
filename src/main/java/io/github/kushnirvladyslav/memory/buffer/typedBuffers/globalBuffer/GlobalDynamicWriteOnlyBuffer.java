/**
 * Implementation of a dynamic write-only global OpenCL buffer.
 * This buffer type combines dynamic resizing capabilities with write-only access,
 * optimized for data that needs to be written from the kernel but never read from it.
 *
 * <p>Dynamic write-only global buffers:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Support writing data to the device</li>
 *   <li>Prevent reading from the device</li>
 *   <li>Use CL_MEM_READ_WRITE flag for full access</li>
 *   <li>Support automatic resizing</li>
 * </ul>
