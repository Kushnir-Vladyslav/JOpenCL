/**
 * Implementation of a static read-write global OpenCL buffer.
 * This buffer type provides both read and write operations with a fixed size.
 * Unlike dynamic buffers, static buffers maintain a constant size throughout their lifecycle.
 *
 * <p>Static read-write global buffers:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Support both reading and writing operations</li>
 *   <li>Have fixed size after initialization</li>
 *   <li>Use CL_MEM_READ_WRITE flag for full access</li>
 *   <li>Optimized for fixed-size data structures</li>
 * </ul>
