/**
 * Represents an OpenCL context with associated command queues and device resources.
 * This class encapsulates the OpenCL context and provides high-level management
 * of OpenCL resources and execution capabilities.
 *
 * <p>The context manages:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>Platform and device associations</li>
 *     <li>Command queue operations (including out-of-order execution)</li>
 *     <li>Device-specific command queues for OpenCL 2.0+ devices</li>
 *     <li>Memory buffer management through BufferManager</li>
 *     <li>Memory kernel management through KernelManager</li>
 *     <li>Resource lifecycle and cleanup</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Current implementation focuses on single-device contexts. Future versions will support:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>Multi-device context management</li>
 *     <li>Shared virtual memory (SVM) for OpenCL 2.0+ devices</li>
 *     <li>Advanced synchronization primitives</li>
 *     <li>Cross-device memory management</li>
 *     <li>Event-based profiling and monitoring</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Example usage:
 * <pre>{@code
 * OpenClContext context = OpenCL.createContext()
 *     .withDevice(device)
 *     .create();
 *
 * }</pre>
